-# STAN — STAN Tames Autoregressive Nonsense
+# STAN — STAN Tames Autoregressive Nonsense
+
+This version introduces a stable stanPath layout and a bootloader.
+
+Key changes:
+- stanPath replaces outputPath in stan.config.yml (default: stan).
+- System files live under stan/system (e.g., stan/system/stan.system.md, stan/system/stan.bootloader.md).
+- Script and archive outputs live under stan/output.
+- Diff state lives under stan/diff.
+- Dev CLI build lives under stan/dist.
+
+## Bootloader
+
+- The file stan/system/stan.bootloader.md is a minimal system prompt that instructs the assistant to:
+  - scan all conversation attachments (newest first),
+  - integrity‑check any tar archives,
+  - locate stan/system/stan.system.md at the repository root of the latest artifact,
+  - and use that as the governing system prompt.
+- If stan/system/stan.system.md cannot be found, the assistant must not proceed and should request it.
+- 10‑backtick fences are for presentation in chat only. They format code/patch blocks for copying; the fences themselves are not part of what you paste into files or patch tools.
+
+## Updated directories
+
+- stan/system: policy documents (stan.system.md, stan.project.template.md, stan.bootloader.md)
+- stan/output: script outputs and archive.tar/archive.diff.tar
+- stan/diff: snapshot and diff metadata (.archive.snapshot.json, .stan_no_changes, archive.prev.tar)
+- stan/dist: development CLI build (used by stan:build)
+
+## Config
