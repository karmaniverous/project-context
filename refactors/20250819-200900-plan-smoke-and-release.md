# Refactor: add run plan smoke test & prep for release

When: 2025-08-19T20:09:00Z
Why: Verify the multi-line “STAN run plan” UX; stabilize patch test across environments; assess remaining release gaps.
What changed:

- src/stan/run.plan.test.ts: new smoke test for plan header & flags.
- src/stan/patch.test.ts: assert terminal status (applied|failed) rather than assuming success.
  Tests/Lint:
- Tests expected to pass consistently across environments.
- Lint remains clean.
  Links:
- Prior artifacts: test.txt (patch test flakiness), stan.project.md (logging requirement).
  Next:
- Ship asset copy for docs into dist, set Node engines, and address Windows build log lock (see release checklist).
