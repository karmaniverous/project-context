# Refactor: OSS-first + dependency hygiene

When: 2025-08-19T16:05:00Z
Why: Enforce “search before building” and ensure dependencies are added/installed when referenced; re-emphasize alias usage.
What changed:

- stan.system.md: added Open‑Source First policy; added Dependency & Tooling Hygiene; reiterated @ alias guidance for non‑sibling imports.
  Tests/Lint:
- Policy only (no code changes); no test/lint impact.
  Next:
- None.
