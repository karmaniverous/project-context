Refactor: snap --stash flag and fence note
When: 2025-08-20T16:05:00Z
Why: Improve snapshot fidelity by stashing untracked/modified files during stan snap; clarify presentation fences are not part of copied patches.
What changed:

src/stan/snap.ts: added -s, --stash; implemented git stash -u before snapshot and git stash pop after (best-effort, logs on error).
stan.system.md: documented that 10-backtick fences are presentational and not included when users copy patches.
Tests/Lint:
No tests modified; feature is opt-in and logs on failures without aborting snapshot.
Typecheck: unchanged; Lint: unchanged.
Next:
Consider surfacing explicit messages for stash/pop outcomes under STAN_DEBUG=1.
