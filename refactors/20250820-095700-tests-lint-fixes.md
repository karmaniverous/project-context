# Refactor: fix selection test order and TSDoc warnings

When: 2025-08-20T09:57:00Z
Why: New selection model preserves config order for `-s` with no keys; test incorrectly asserted alphabetical order. ESLint flagged `>` in TSDoc.
What changed:

- src/cli/stan/runner.test.ts: removed `.sort()` expectation; assert config order only.
- src/stan/run.ts: escaped `>` in TSDoc (“=\>”) to silence warnings.
  Tests/Lint:
- Tests: expected to pass (previous single failure addressed).
- Lint: tsdoc warnings resolved.
  Next:
- Consider adding an e2e test for `stan run -a` to cover validation and archive-only runs.
