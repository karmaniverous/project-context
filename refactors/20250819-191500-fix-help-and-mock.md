# Refactor: fix help footer test and child_process mock

When: 2025-08-19T19:15:00Z
Why: Lint failed on async test with no await; tests failed due to help footer not captured via outputHelp and Vitest mock missing default export.
What changed:

- src/cli/stan/index.help.test.ts: use helpInformation() and remove async; assert footer and subcommands.
- src/stan/patch.test.ts: provide Vitest-compliant ESM mock with default export and spawn that closes with code 0.
  Tests/Lint:
- Lint: require-await error resolved.
- Tests: the two failing suites should pass with these fixes.
  Links:
- Artifacts: lint.txt (original error), test.txt (original failures)
  Next:
- None.
