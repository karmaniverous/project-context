# STAN ‚Äî STAN Tames Autoregressive Nonsense

üé≤ A tip of the hat to Stanis≈Çaw Ulam.

In 1946, while recovering from illness and noodling over card games, Ulam helped ignite the Monte Carlo method‚Äîrandom sampling to tackle hard, deterministic problems.

STAN produces a single source of truth for AI‚Äëassisted development: a tarball of your repo plus deterministic outputs from your build/test/lint/typecheck scripts.

You get portable, auditable, reproducible context‚Äîlocally and in CI.

Because a freaking chatbot shouldn‚Äôt gaslight your code.

## Why STAN?

- One archive (on demand). With `-a/--archive`, `archive.tar` captures the exact files to read‚Äîno surprises.
- Structured logs. `stan/test.txt`, `stan/lint.txt`, `stan/typecheck.txt`, `stan/build.txt` are consistent and easy to diff.
- Always-on diffs (when archiving). Whenever you use `-a`, STAN writes `stan/archive.diff.tar` for changed files‚Äîno extra ceremony. First time? The diff equals the full set (sensible defaults, zero ceremony).
- Snapshot with intent. Normal runs create a snapshot only when missing; use `stan snap` when you want to reset or replace it. Your diffs stay meaningful.
- Patch on tap. Got a suggested patch from an AI or teammate? Save it and run `stan patch` to apply it safely at your repo root.
- Simpler combine. With `-a -c`, script outputs live inside the archives (not on disk). No separate ‚Äúcombined artifact‚Äù to maintain.

Backronym bonus: Sample ‚Ä¢ Tar ‚Ä¢ Analyze ‚Ä¢ Narrate ‚Äî STAN Tames Autoregressive Nonsense.

## Install

```
npm i -D @karmaniverous/stan
# or
pnpm add -D @karmaniverous/stan
# or
yarn add -D @karmaniverous/stan
```

The CLI installs as `stan`.

## Quickstart

1. Initialize config

```
npx stan init
```

This scaffolds `stan.config.yml` (or JSON) with an output path (default `stan/`) and a script map.

2. Check the config

Example `stan.config.yml`:

```
outputPath: stan
includes: []
excludes: []
scripts:
  build: npm run build
  knip: npm run knip
  lint: npm run lint
  test: npm run test
  typecheck: npm run typecheck
defaultPatchFile: /stan.patch
```

3. Generate artifacts

```
# Run all configured scripts
npx stan run -s

# Run selected scripts only (preserves order with -q)
npx stan run -s test typecheck -q

# Run all except <keys> (reduces from full set when -s absent)
npx stan run -x lint

# Reduce a selected set with -x
npx stan run -s test typecheck -x test

# Produce code archives (regular + diff) after running scripts
npx stan run -a -s

# Put script outputs INSIDE the archives (and do not keep them on disk)
npx stan run -a -c -s
```

Tip: enable debug globally

```
# Global debug applies to all subcommands
npx stan -d run -s
```

## Snapshot & Diff (the duo)

- Always-on diffs (with `-a`): If you pass `-a/--archive`, STAN writes `stan/archive.diff.tar` containing only changed files since the last snapshot.
- First-run behavior: No snapshot yet? Your diff equals the full set‚Äîsimple and predictable.
- Snapshot policy:
  - Normal runs: Create a snapshot only if one does not exist.
  - Explicit reset/update: Use `stan snap` to (re)write the snapshot on demand.
- Previous full archive: STAN maintains `stan/.diff/archive.prev.tar` for reference.

## CLI

```
stan run [options]
```

### Options

- Selection (one of -a, -s, or -x is required)
  - `-s, --scripts [keys...]`: run only these keys. If no keys are listed, all scripts run.
  - `-x, --except-scripts <keys...>`: exclude these keys. If `-s` is present, reduces that set; otherwise reduces from the full set.
- Execution mode
  - `-q, --sequential`: run scripts sequentially in config order. Requires `-s` or `-x`.
- Archives & outputs
  - `-a, --archive`: after scripts run (or immediately if selection is empty), write `archive.tar` and `archive.diff.tar`.
  - `-c, --combine`: include script outputs inside the archives and do not keep them on disk. Implies `--archive` and requires `-s` or `-x`. Conflicts with `--keep`.
  - `-k, --keep`: do not clear the output directory before running. Conflicts with `--combine`.

Global:

- `-d, --debug` (on `stan`): enable verbose debug logging for all subcommands.

### stan patch

Apply a patch shared via chat or a file:

- Default: read from clipboard (base64 or unified diff), save to the designated patch file, apply it.
- From file: `stan patch -f` (uses the default patch file, e.g. `/stan.patch`) or `stan patch -f my.patch`
- Dry run: add `-c/--check` to validate without changing files.

Behavior details:

- Detection: If clipboard/file content looks like base64 and decodes to a unified diff (e.g., contains `diff --git`, `---`, `+++`, `@@`), it will be decoded. Otherwise, the text is treated as a raw unified diff.
- Cleanups: code fences/banners removed, zero‚Äëwidth characters stripped, line endings normalized to LF, and a final newline ensured. Whitespace within lines is preserved.
- Application strategy: tries `git apply` with tolerant settings over both strip levels:
  - `--3way --whitespace=nowarn -p1`, then `--3way --ignore-whitespace -p1`, then `--reject --whitespace=nowarn -p1`
  - If needed, repeats with `-p0`
- Windows note: Passing very large base64 as an inline command-line argument can exceed the ~32K character limit. Clipboard default or `-f` are recommended for large patches.

### `stan snap`

Explicitly (re)generate the diff snapshot‚Äîwithout writing an archive:

```
npx stan snap
```

Useful when you want to ‚Äúre-baseline‚Äù diffs after intentional changes.
