# STAN ‚Äî STAN Tames Autoregressive Nonsense

üé≤ A tip of the hat to Stanis≈Çaw Ulam.

In 1946, while recovering from illness and noodling over card games, Ulam helped ignite the Monte Carlo method‚Äîrandom sampling to tackle hard, deterministic problems.

STAN produces a single source of truth for AI‚Äëassisted development: a tarball of your repo plus deterministic outputs from your build/test/lint/typecheck scripts.

You get portable, auditable, reproducible context‚Äîlocally and in CI.

Because a freaking chatbot shouldn‚Äôt gaslight your code.

## Why STAN?

- One archive (on demand). With `-a/--archive`, `archive.tar` captures the exact files to read‚Äîno surprises.
- Structured logs. `stan/test.txt`, `stan/lint.txt`, `stan/typecheck.txt`, `stan/build.txt` are consistent and easy to diff.
- Always-on diffs (when archiving). Whenever you use `-a`, STAN writes `stan/archive.diff.tar` for changed files‚Äîno extra ceremony. First time? The diff equals the full set (sensible defaults, zero ceremony).
- Snapshot with intent. Normal runs create a snapshot only when missing; use `stan snap` when you want to reset or replace it. Your diffs stay meaningful.
- Patch on tap. Got a suggested patch from an AI or teammate? Save it and run `stan patch` to apply it safely at your repo root.
- Simpler combine. With `-a -c`, script outputs live inside the archives (not on disk). No separate ‚Äúcombined artifact‚Äù to maintain.

Backronym bonus: Sample ‚Ä¢ Tar ‚Ä¢ Analyze ‚Ä¢ Narrate ‚Äî STAN Tames Autoregressive Nonsense.

## Install

Global install (recommended for CLI usage):

```
npm i -g @karmaniverous/stan
# or
pnpm add -g @karmaniverous/stan
# or
yarn global add @karmaniverous/stan
```

Then run the CLI as `stan ...` from any project.

Local (dev) install (optional):

```
npm i -D @karmaniverous/stan
```

The CLI installs as `stan`.

Verify:

```
stan --version
stan --help
```

## Quickstart

1. Initialize config

```
stan init
```

This scaffolds `stan.config.yml` (or JSON) with an output path (default `stan/`) and a script map.

2. Check the config

Example `stan.config.yml`:

```
stanPath: stan
includes: []
excludes: []
scripts:
  build: npm run stan:build
  lint: npm run lint
  test: npm run test
  typecheck: npm run typecheck
```

3. Generate artifacts

```
# Run all configured scripts
stan run -s

# Run selected scripts only (preserves order with -q)
stan run -s test typecheck -q

# Run all except <keys> (reduces from full set when -s absent)
stan run -x lint

# Reduce a selected set with -x
stan run -s test typecheck -x test

# Produce code archives (regular + diff) after running scripts
stan run -a -s

# Put script outputs INSIDE the archives (and do not keep them on disk)
stan run -a -c -s
```

Tip: enable debug globally

```
# Global debug applies to all subcommands
stan -d run -s
```

## Snapshot & Diff (the duo)

- Always-on diffs (with `-a`): If you pass `-a/--archive`, STAN writes `stan/archive.diff.tar` containing only changed files since the last snapshot.
- First-run behavior: No snapshot yet? Your diff equals the full set‚Äîsimple and predictable.
- Snapshot policy:
  - Normal runs: Create a snapshot only if one does not exist.
  - Explicit reset/update: Use `stan snap` to (re)write the snapshot on demand.
- Previous full archive: STAN maintains `stan/diff/archive.prev.tar` for reference.

## CLI

```
stan run [options]
```

### Options

- Selection (one of -a, -s, or -x is required)
  - `-s, --scripts [keys...]`: run only these keys. If no keys are listed, all scripts run.
  - `-x, --except-scripts <keys...>`: exclude these keys. If `-s` is present, reduces that set; otherwise reduces from the full set.
- Execution mode
  - `-q, --sequential`: run scripts sequentially in config order. Requires `-s` or `-x`.
- Archives & outputs
  - `-a, --archive`: after scripts run (or immediately if selection is empty), write `archive.tar` and `archive.diff.tar`.
    - STAN logs a summary of excluded binary files and large text files to the console at archive time.
  - `-c, --combine`: include script outputs inside the archives and do not keep them on disk. Implies `--archive` and requires `-s` or `-x`. Conflicts with `--keep`.
  - `-k, --keep`: do not clear the output directory before running. Conflicts with `--combine`.

Global:

- `-d, --debug` (on `stan`): enable verbose debug logging for all subcommands.

### stan patch

Apply a patch shared via chat or a file.

Common flows:

```
# Clean and apply a patch from the clipboard (default)
stan patch

# Validate a patch from the clipboard without changing files
stan patch --check

# Read a patch from a file (unified diff) and apply it
stan patch -f my.patch

# Validate a patch file only
stan patch -f my.patch --check

# Alternatively, pass the diff inline as an argument (beware shell limits on very large diffs)
stan patch "diff --git a/x b/x
--- a/x
+++ b/x
@@ -1,1 +1,1 @@
-old
+new"
```

Behavior details:

- Canonical workspace:
  - Cleaned input is written to `<stanPath>/patch/.patch`.
  - Diagnostics live under `<stanPath>/patch/.debug/`:
    - `cleaned.patch` ‚Äî the cleaned unified diff that was applied/checked.
    - `attempts.json` ‚Äî summary of each apply attempt (git/jsdiff), plus
      per‚Äëattempt `*.stderr.txt` and `*.stdout.txt`.
  - Any newly created `*.rej` files are moved to `<stanPath>/patch/rejects/<UTC timestamp>/` (paths preserved).
- Detection: If clipboard/file content looks like base64 and decodes to a unified diff (e.g., contains `diff --git`, `---`, `+++`, `@@`), it will be decoded. Otherwise, the text is treated as a raw unified diff.
- Cleanups: code fences/banners removed, zero‚Äëwidth characters stripped, line endings normalized to LF, and a final newline ensured. Whitespace within lines is preserved.
- Application strategy: tries `git apply` with tolerant settings over both strip levels:
  - `--3way --whitespace=nowarn --recount -p1`
  - `--3way --ignore-whitespace --recount -p1`
  - `--reject --whitespace=nowarn --recount -p1`
  - If needed, repeats with `-p0` in the same order.
- Feedback (failed/partial/check):
  - On failure, partial success, or `--check`, STAN builds a compact FEEDBACK envelope and:
    - saves it to `<stanPath>/patch/.debug/feedback.txt`, and
    - copies it to the clipboard.
  - The console will log:
    - `stan: wrote patch feedback -> <path>`
    - `stan: copied patch feedback to clipboard -> <path>` (or `<clipboard only>` if the file write failed)
  - Paste this FEEDBACK back into chat verbatim to get a corrected patch tailored to the failure.
- Windows note: Passing very large base64 as an inline command-line argument can exceed the ~32K character limit. Clipboard default or `-f` are recommended for large patches.

### `stan snap`

Explicitly (re)generate the diff snapshot‚Äîwithout writing an archive:

```
stan snap
```

Useful when you want to ‚Äúre-baseline‚Äù diffs after intentional changes.

## Bootloader (wire STAN into your AI agent)

STAN ships a minimal ‚Äúbootloader‚Äù system prompt that you can paste into the AI assistant you use (ChatGPT, Claude, a local agent, etc.). Its only job is to:

- integrity‚Äëcheck any attached tar archives,
- locate `<stanPath>/system/stan.system.md` inside the latest artifact (using stanPath from `stan.config.*`), and
- load that file as the governing system prompt for the rest of the conversation (refusing to proceed if it‚Äôs missing).

Where to find it:

- In your repo: `<stanPath>/system/stan.bootloader.md` (default: `stan/system/stan.bootloader.md`).
- From the npm package: `node_modules/@karmaniverous/stan/dist/stan.bootloader.md` (we also ship `stan.system.md` and `stan.project.template.md` under `dist/` for convenience).

How to use it:

1. Generate artifacts with STAN:
   - `stan run -a -s` (or select the scripts you need).
   - This writes `stan/output/archive.tar` (and `archive.diff.tar`).

2. In your AI tool, set the system prompt to the contents of `stan.bootloader.md`.

3. Attach `archive.tar` (and `archive.diff.tar` if present). If you used `-c/--combine`, your script outputs are already inside those archives; otherwise you can attach the text logs too.

4. State your request (e.g., ‚ÄúFix the failing tests‚Äù or ‚ÄúRefactor X‚Äù).
   - The bootloader will switch the AI to `stan.system.md` automatically.

Troubleshooting:

- If the AI reports that `stan/system/stan.system.md` is missing, ensure:
  - your archive contains `<stanPath>/system/stan.system.md` (default `stan/system/stan.system.md`),
  - your `stan.config.yml|json` is present and has the correct `stanPath`, or
  - attach a raw file named exactly `stan.system.md` as a separate file.
  - When `--archive` runs, STAN prints a console summary of excluded binaries and large text files to help you refine `includes`/`excludes`.

## Snap history, stash, and archives

`snap` maintains a bounded history and can optionally stash before capturing:

- History and navigation:
  - `stan snap` ‚Äî write a new snapshot (pushes history, clears redos).
  - `stan snap undo` ‚Äî move to the previous snapshot and restore it.
  - `stan snap redo` ‚Äî move forward in history and restore it.
  - `stan snap set 0` ‚Äî jump to a specific history index and restore it.
  - `stan snap info` ‚Äî show newest‚Üíoldest stack with local timestamps; marks the current index.

- Stash changes first:
  - `stan snap -s` ‚Äî runs `git stash -u` before snapshot; after success, attempts `git stash pop`.
    - If `stash -u` fails: snapshot is aborted (no changes made).
    - If `stash pop` fails: a warning is logged; the snapshot remains.

- Archive captures with the snapshot:
  - If `stan/output/archive.tar` or `archive.diff.tar` exist at snap time, STAN copies them into `stan/diff/archives/` with the same timestamp stem as the snapshot (e.g., `archive-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar`).
  - Snapshots are stored under `stan/diff/snapshots/` and the active snapshot lives at `stan/diff/.archive.snapshot.json`.

- History depth:
  - Defaults to 10 entries; override by adding `maxUndos: <n>` to `stan.config.*`.

Example session:

```
# Create baseline snapshot
stan snap

# Make intentional changes, then replace baseline and capture any current archives
stan snap -s

# Inspect and navigate history
stan snap info
stan snap undo
stan snap redo
stan snap set 0
```

## Large-file guidance (300+ lines)

To keep patches focused and modules testable, STAN flags any source file longer than 300 lines and requests a plan.

What you‚Äôll see:

- A list of long files (path + LOC).
- For each file, either:
  - a short outline for splitting it (proposed modules, responsibilities, and test strategy), or
  - a documented reason to keep it long (e.g., generated code, cohesive DSL, or deliberate monolith with clear navigation).

Example checklist (assistant output):

```
Long files (>300 LOC) detected:
1) src/feature/engine.ts ‚Äî ~512 LOC
   - Proposal: Split into
     ‚Ä¢ engine/core.ts (state + lifecycle)
     ‚Ä¢ engine/plugins.ts (registry + hooks)
     ‚Ä¢ engine/runner.ts (execution, error boundaries)
   - Tests: unit per module + high-level integration

2) src/vendor/sql-grammar.ts ‚Äî ~1,042 LOC
   - Decision: Keep long (generated grammar; splitting harms maintainability)
   - Action: Add a README note and exclude from coverage thresholds
```

No changes are made automatically; STAN waits for confirmation on which files to split before emitting patches.
