STAN produces a single source of truth for AI‚Äëassisted development: a tarball of your repo plus deterministic outputs from your build/test/lint/typecheck scripts.  
You get portable, auditable, reproducible context‚Äîlocally and in CI.

Why STAN?

- One archive. stan/archive.tar captures the exact files to read‚Äîno surprises.
- Structured logs. stan/test.txt, stan/lint.txt, stan/typecheck.txt, stan/build.txt are consistent and easy to diff.
- Always-on diffs. Whenever you include the archive task, STAN writes stan/archive.diff.tar for changed files‚Äîno extra flag needed. First time? The diff equals the full set (sensible defaults, zero ceremony).
- Snapshot with intent. Normal runs create a snapshot only when missing; use stan snap when you want to reset or replace it. Your diffs stay meaningful.
- Patch on tap. Got a suggested patch from an AI or teammate? Save it and run stan patch to apply it safely at your repo root.
- Optional combine. One artifact to rule them all‚Äîtar your output directory alongside the code or condense logs into a single text file.

Backronym bonus: Sample ‚Ä¢ Tar ‚Ä¢ Analyze ‚Ä¢ Narrate ‚Äî STAN Tames Autoregressive Nonsense.

Install

```
npm i -D @karmaniverous/stan
# or
pnpm add -D @karmaniverous/stan
# or
yarn add -D @karmaniverous/stan
```

The CLI installs as stan.

Quickstart

1. Initialize config

```
npx stan init
```

This scaffolds stan.config.yml (or JSON) with an output path (default stan/) and a script map.

2. Check the config

Example stan.config.yml:

```
outputPath: stan
combinedFileName: combined
scripts:
  build: npm run build
  knip: npm run knip
  lint: npm run lint
  test: npm run test
  typecheck: npm run typecheck
```

3. Generate artifacts

```
# runs all configured scripts concurrently; creates stan/archive.tar
npx stan

# run selected scripts only (preserves order when -s is used)
npx stan test typecheck -s

# run all except <keys>
npx stan -e knip lint

# combine outputs into a single artifact
npx stan -c

# compute an archive diff (always-on when archive runs; snapshot is created on first run)
npx stan -d   # optional; retained for plan display
```

Snapshot & Diff (the duo)

- Always-on diffs: If you include the archive task, STAN writes stan/archive.diff.tar containing only changed files since the last snapshot.
- First-run behavior: No snapshot yet? Your diff equals the full set‚Äîsimple and predictable.
- Snapshot policy:
  - Normal runs: Create a snapshot only if one does not exist.
  - Explicit reset/update: Use stan snap to (re)write the snapshot on demand.
- Previous full archive: STAN maintains stan/.diff/archive.prev.tar for reference.

CLI

```
stan [scripts...] [options]
```

When you run stan --help, the footer lists script keys discovered from your config, and always includes the special archive task.

Selection

- [scripts...]: run only these keys in order (when paired with -s).
- -e, --except <keys...>: run all scripts except these.

Execution mode

- Default is concurrent.
- -s, --sequential: run scripts sequentially, preserving the enumerated order.

Artifacts

- Default: Clears the output directory (unless --keep), creates stan/archive.tar, and writes one text file per script (e.g., stan/test.txt).
- -k, --keep: Do not clear the output directory before running.

Combine

- -c, --combine:
  - If archive is present among jobs, STAN runs non‚Äëarchive jobs first, then creates a single combined tar (including the output directory). It does not also create archive.tar.
  - If archive is not present, STAN combines produced text outputs into a single <name>.txt.
  - The base name <name> is controlled by the combinedFileName config key (default: combined).

Diff

- Always-on when archive runs; stan/archive.diff.tar is written every time.
- Snapshot lives at <outputPath>/.diff/.archive.snapshot.json and is created when missing (or replaced via stan snap).

New: stan snap

Explicitly (re)generate the diff snapshot‚Äîwithout writing an archive:

```
npx stan snap
```

Useful when you want to ‚Äúre-baseline‚Äù diffs after intentional changes.

New: stan patch

Apply a repo-root‚Äìrelative patch with a single command:

```
# Save a diff to /stan.patch, then:
npx stan patch

# or specify a file:
npx stan patch ./my-fix.patch
```

- Paths beginning with / are treated as repo-root relative for portability.
- Default location is configurable via defaultPatchFile in your config (defaults to /stan.patch).

What gets produced?

By default (with outputPath: stan):

```
stan/
‚îú‚îÄ archive.tar
‚îú‚îÄ archive.diff.tar          # always produced when archive runs
‚îú‚îÄ .diff/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ .archive.snapshot.json
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ archive.prev.tar
‚îú‚îÄ build.txt
‚îú‚îÄ lint.txt
‚îú‚îÄ test.txt
‚îú‚îÄ typecheck.txt
‚îî‚îÄ combined.txt              # when --combine without archive
```

Pro tip: The multi-line plan

Before scripts run, STAN prints a compact, multi-line plan showing your mode, output path, selected scripts, and whether archive/combine/diff/keep are engaged. It‚Äôs a quick sanity check that doubles as a log breadcrumb.

CI Example (GitHub Actions)

```
name: STAN snapshots
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  stan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx stan -c -d
      - name: Upload STAN artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: stan
          path: stan/
```

Tips & Troubleshooting

- Prefer portable script entries in your config (e.g., npm run test). STAN captures stdout + stderr for deterministic logs.
- Add the output directory (default stan/) to your .gitignore.
- Don‚Äôt see the snapshot you expect? Run npx stan snap to explicitly reset it.
- Avoid Windows file-handle collisions: if you pipe build logs to a file that‚Äôs open in another process, close the viewer or use a unique temp file for the build run.

FAQ

Is this better than IDE‚Äënative AI?  
Different goals. IDE AI is great for local tinkering and inline edits; STAN shines when you need reproducible, shareable context (PRs, CI, multi‚Äëagent reviews).

Why tarballs?  
They‚Äôre portable, inspectable, and easy to cache. Your AI agent can verify contents and report exact file sizes and hashes for auditability.

Can I store STAN artifacts?  
Yes‚Äîtreat them like build outputs. They‚Äôre perfect for attaching to CI runs or sharing with teammates.
