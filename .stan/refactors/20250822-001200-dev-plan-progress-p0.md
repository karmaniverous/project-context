# Refactor: Dev Plan progress (P0 jsdiff + reporter polish)
When: 2025-08-22T00:12:00Z (UTC)
Why: System-level requirement — keep the Dev Plan current as we complete milestones. This turn delivered jsdiff fallback stabilization, reporter polish, and sandbox retention; all tests pass and typecheck/docs are clean.

What changed:
- .stan/system/stan.todo.md:
  - Marked jsdiff fallback engine as DONE (diff v8 API; CRLF preserved; passing test).
  - Reporter polish: attempts.json now includes git+jsdiff; print brief last‑error snippet in non‑debug mode.
  - Sandbox retention: prune <stanPath>/patch/.sandbox to latest few (default 5).
  - Adjusted P0 scope and acceptance criteria accordingly; clarified next P0 items (parse/resolver, FEEDBACK envelope polish, optional DMP).

Tests/Lint:
- tests: 32/32 passing.
- typecheck/docs: clean.
- lint: Prettier errors cleared (test-only suppression for jsdiff test); only TSDoc warnings remain.

Next:
- P0: implement parse/resolver (per-file hunks) and optional DMP; add last‑error summary into FEEDBACK envelope; extend tests.
- P1: wire preflightDocsAndVersion at run start; add tests.
