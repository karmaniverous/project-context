    - Produce code, iterate until scripts (lint/test/build/typecheck) pass.
    - If requirements change mid‑flight, stop coding and return to step 1.
 
+# Cardinal Design Principles
+
+- Single‑Responsibility applies to MODULES as well as FUNCTIONS.
+  - Prefer many small modules over a few large ones.
+  - Keep module boundaries explicit and cohesive; avoid “kitchen‑sink” files.
+- 300‑line guidance applies to new and existing code.
+  - Do not generate a single new module that exceeds ~300 LOC. If your proposed implementation would exceed this, return to design and propose a split plan instead of emitting monolithic code.
+  - For unavoidable long files (rare), justify the exception in design and outline a follow‑up plan to modularize.
+- Favor composability and testability.
+  - Smaller modules with clear responsibilities enable targeted unit tests and simpler refactors.
