# Refactor: CLI lint cleanups + testing principle

When: 2025-08-19T14:15:00Z
Why: Tests passed but ESLint flagged redundant boolean cast and unused vars/type assertions. Also codify “no-internals testing” principle.
What changed:

- src/cli/stan/run-args.ts: remove redundant Boolean() in ternary.
- src/cli/stan/runner.ts: drop unused param; remove unnecessary assertions.
- stan.system.md: add testing guideline to avoid tests that rely on internals.
  Tests/Lint:
- Tests: still pass (19/19).
- Lint: expected to be clean.
  Links:
- Artifacts: ctx/lint.txt (previous 4 errors).
  Next:
- Optional: address intermittent Windows build file lock in stan:build (non-blocking).
