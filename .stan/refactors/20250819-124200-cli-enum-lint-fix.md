# Refactor: CLI enumeration + lint safety

When: 2025-08-19T12:42:00Z
Why: Two CLI tests still returned selection=null; ESLint flagged unsafe spreads in runner.ts.
What changed:

- src/cli/stan/runner.ts:
  - Treat action enumerated param as string | string[] (unknown at runtime).
  - Add recursive `stringsFrom` to safely collect nested strings; remove unsafe spreads.
  - Keep robust fallbacks using `command.args` and `command.processedArgs`.
    Tests/Lint:
- tests: expected failures in runner tests should pass.
- lint: clears two @typescript-eslint unsafe spread errors.
  Next:
- None.
