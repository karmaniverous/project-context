 - Binary: do not include binary patches.
 
+# Archives & preflight (binary/large files; baseline/version awareness)
+- Binary exclusion:
+  - The archiver explicitly excludes binary files even if they slip past other rules.
+  - STAN logs a concise note and writes a full list to `<stanPath>/output/archive.warnings.txt` (included in archives).
+- Large text callâ€‘outs:
+  - STAN identifies large text files (by size and/or LOC) as candidates for exclusion and lists them in `archive.warnings.txt`, suggesting globs to add to `excludes`.
+- Preflight baseline check on `stan run`:
+  - Compare `<stanPath>/system/stan.system.md` to the packaged baseline (dist). If drifted in downstream repos, warn that local edits will be overwritten by `stan init` and suggest moving customizations to the project prompt; offer to revert to baseline.
+  - Track last installed docs version (e.g., `<stanPath>/system/.docs.meta.json`). If the installed package version is newer and docs changed, nudge to run `stan init` to update docs.
+- Version CLI:
+  - `stan -v`/`--version` prints STAN version, Node version, repo root, resolved `stanPath`, and doc baseline status (in sync vs drifted; last docs version vs current).
