/**
 * Diff helpers for the stan tool.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS (current):
 * - `createArchiveDiff({ cwd, outputPath, baseName, includes?, excludes? })`:
 *   - Maintain <outputPath>/.archive.snapshot.json (path â†’ sha256 hex).
 *   - On first run or when no changes detected, write a sentinel `.stan_no_changes`
 *     into the output directory and create `<baseName>.diff.tar` containing just that sentinel.
 *   - When changes are detected, create `<baseName>.diff.tar` containing only changed files
 *     (added or modified). Deletions are tracked in the snapshot but not included in the tar.
 * - Honor includes/excludes and basic .gitignore prefix rules via shared helpers.
 *
 * NEW REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Diff support artifacts are stored under <outputPath>/.diff:
 *   - snapshot: <outputPath>/.diff/.archive.snapshot.json
 *   - sentinel: <outputPath>/.diff/.stan_no_changes
 * - The produced diff tar remains at <outputPath>/<baseName>.diff.tar.
